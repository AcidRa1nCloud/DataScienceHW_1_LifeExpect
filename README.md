# Predicting Life Expectancy using Neural Networks and Machine Learning Methods

This repository contains the code and documentation for my home assignment project focused on predicting the life expectancy of a country using various neural network architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and machine learning methods such as regularization. The project utilizes a life expectancy dataset sourced from Kaggle to train, validate, and test different models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) dataset from Kaggle. It includes various features such as GDP, education, alcohol consumption, and more, which are potentially influential in predicting life expectancy. The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure it is ready for training.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `./data`: This directory contains the dataset files. The main dataset file used for training is `life_expectancy.csv`.

- `./saved_models`: This directory contains the trained model files saved after training.

- `data.py`: This script contains functions to load and preprocess the dataset.

- `engine.py`: This script includes functions for model training, validation, and testing.

- `models/`: This directory holds the source code for the different neural network architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization methods.

- `params.py`: This script contains hyperparameters and configuration settings for the models.

- `utils.py`: Utility functions and scripts used throughout the project are stored here.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies required to run the code in this repository.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project by creating pull requests. Suggestions, bug fixes, and improvements are always welcome.
